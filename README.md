# Fixing Broken Springboard React Exercises

I created new instances of Create React App and then migrated over necessary files, working versions at the starting point of the exercise will be available inside of this repo.

## Available Scripts (READ ABOUT TESTING)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` works, `jest` does not seem to

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
